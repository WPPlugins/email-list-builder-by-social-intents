== Description ==
[List Builder](http://www.socialintents.com) by Social Intents lets you quickly add an email list sign up form to any page to allow visitors to join your email list.  Instead of a sidebar widget, our mailing list builder brings extra attention by popping up an elegant lightbox. It can be configured to display after a period of time on your website, or as visitors are exiting your site using exit intents.  Add your CSS, your language, your background images, and your style to the form.  It's one of the fastest and most effective ways to build your email lists.
